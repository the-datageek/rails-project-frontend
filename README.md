## Description
Cooking at home has become a popular trend, and many people are looking for new and exciting recipes to try. The problem is that people are finding it difficult to discover new recipes that match their cooking skills, and personal preferences. This leads to a lack of variety in their diet.We created Tasty Trail, a recipe finding app which has a user-friendly interface that helps individuals explore new cuisines and ingredients while also expanding their creativity by letting them create new recipes and save them in the app.
